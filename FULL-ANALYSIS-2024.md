# Golf Yardage Calculator - Full Analysis Report 2024

## Overview
The Golf Yardage Calculator is a comprehensive web application that calculates shot adjustments based on environmental conditions. The application consists of three main components: weather adjustments, wind calculations, and core physics computations.

## Core Components Analysis

### 1. Weather Adjustments
âœ… **Working Correctly**
- Temperature effects properly scaled (0.1 yards per degree F from 70Â°F)
- Humidity impact accurately modeled (0.8% effect from 0-100%)
- Altitude calculations match empirical data
- Air density calculations properly implemented

### 2. Wind Calculations
âœ… **Well Implemented**
- Headwind/tailwind effects accurate (-6.5%/+6.5% at 10mph)
- Crosswind calculations precise (6.8% lateral at 15mph)
- Shot height adjustments properly scaled:
  - Low shots: 0.65x wind effect
  - Medium shots: 1.0x wind effect
  - High shots: 1.35x wind effect

### 3. User Interface
ðŸŸ¡ **Needs Improvement**
- Weather page results visibility issues
- Wind visualization needs better mobile support
- Chart responsiveness could be improved

        calculateEffect,
        calculateTrajectory
    }
};

// Add calculation caching
const calculationCache = new Map();
function getCachedCalculation(conditions) {
    const key = JSON.stringify(conditions);
    if (calculationCache.has(key)) return calculationCache.get(key);
    const result = performCalculation(conditions);
    calculationCache.set(key, result);
    return result;
}

// Implement proper error handling
function validateInput(conditions) {
    const limits = {
        temperature: { min: -50, max: 120 },
        humidity: { min: 0, max: 100 },
        altitude: { min: -1000, max: 15000 },
        windSpeed: { min: 0, max: 50 }
    };
    
    Object.entries(conditions).forEach(([key, value]) => {
        const limit = limits[key];
        if (limit && (value < limit.min || value > limit.max)) {
            throw new Error(`${key} out of range: ${value}`);
