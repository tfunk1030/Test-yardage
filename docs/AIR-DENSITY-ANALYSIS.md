- 9 Iron (150y carry):
  - Base Ball Speed: 103 mph (unchanged by air density)
  - Distance Change: -3.1 yards SHORTER
  - Launch: 26°, Spin: 7,000 rpm

### 4. Mild Inland
**Conditions:**
- Temperature: 72°F (+13°F from standard)
- Pressure: 29.85 inHg (-0.07 inHg from standard)
- Humidity: 45% (-5% from standard)
- Elevation: 1,000 ft

**Component Effects:**
- Temperature Effect: -1.23%
- Pressure Effect: -0.11%
- Humidity Effect: +0.04%
- **Total Effect: -1.29%**

**Club-Specific Changes:**
- Driver (288y carry):
  - Base Ball Speed: 167 mph (unchanged by air density)
  - Distance Change: +3.7 yards LONGER
  - Launch: 10.9°, Spin: 2,686 rpm
- 9 Iron (150y carry):
  - Base Ball Speed: 103 mph (unchanged by air density)
  - Distance Change: +1.9 yards LONGER
  - Launch: 26°, Spin: 7,000 rpm

## Key Findings

1. **Elevation is Dominant:**
   - Denver shows the largest effect (-9.98%) due to significantly lower air pressure
   - Each 1,000 ft of elevation typically adds 1-2% to distance

2. **Temperature Impact:**
   - Rule of thumb: ~2-3 yards per 10°F change
   - Hot coastal conditions (-3.96%) show significant temperature effect
   - Cold morning (+2.08%) demonstrates inverse relationship

3. **Humidity Effect:**
   - Minimal impact compared to pressure and temperature
   - Maximum effect is less than 1% from 0-100% humidity
   - Humid air is actually less dense than dry air

4. **Combined Effects:**
   - Effects are multiplicative, not additive
   - Multiple unfavorable conditions compound each other
   - Changes in ball speed are proportional to distance changes

## Practical Applications

1. **Club Selection:**
   - Adjust club selection based on total density effect
   - In Denver, a 150-yard shot might need a 165-yard club
   - Temperature changes of 30°F or more warrant club adjustment

2. **Ball Flight:**
   - Lower density air reduces spin effects
   - May need to adjust launch angle in extreme conditions
   - Ball speed changes affect optimal launch conditions

3. **Practice Strategy:**
   - Note typical conditions at home course
   - Build adjustment table for common weather patterns
   - Pay extra attention to elevation changes when traveling
