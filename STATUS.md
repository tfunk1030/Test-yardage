# Project Status - Golf Distance Calculator

## Current Status (as of Dec 13, 2023)

### Active Development Areas

#### 1. Wind Effect Calibration (PAUSED)
Currently working on achieving ±1% accuracy for all wind conditions.

##### Latest Results:
- 20mph headwind: 241.0y (-0.84%) - Within tolerance
- 10mph headwind: 264.2y (-1.43%) - Just outside tolerance
- 10mph tailwind: 303.1y (-0.96%) - Within tolerance
- 20mph tailwind: 329.5y (+3.28%) - Outside tolerance

##### Target Values:
- 20mph headwind: 243 yards (-45 yards from base)
- 10mph headwind: 268 yards (-20 yards from base)
- Base carry: 288 yards
- 10mph tailwind: 306 yards (+18 yards from base)
- 20mph tailwind: 319 yards (+31 yards from base)

#### 2. Altitude Effects (IN PROGRESS)
Working on precise altitude compensation and validation.

##### Current Implementation:
- Basic altitude compensation model
- ~10% distance increase at Denver altitude (5,280 ft)
- Progressive scaling for higher altitudes
- Need validation with more course data

##### Target Goals:
- Validate against multiple high-altitude courses
- Fine-tune carry distance at key elevations:
  - Sea Level: Baseline
  - Denver (5,280 ft): +10%
  - Mountain courses (7,000+ ft): TBD
- Implement altitude effect on spin rate

#### 3. Temperature/Humidity Modeling (NEEDS REVIEW)
Refining environmental effects on ball flight.

##### Temperature Model Status:
- Basic temperature compensation
- Ball compression effects (4-6 mph variation)
- Need cold weather validation
- Extreme temperature testing pending

##### Humidity Model Status:
- Basic humidity effect (~0.9 yards per 100%)
- Air density adjustments
- Need validation in extreme conditions

##### Target Improvements:
- Validate temperature effects from 20°F to 120°F
- Add cold weather ball compression loss
- Enhance humidity model for tropical conditions

#### 4. Visualization Enhancements (PLANNED)
Improving shot and environmental visualization.

##### Current Features:
- Basic shot trajectory display
- Distance marker
- Height indicator

##### Planned Improvements:
- 3D shot trajectory
- Wind direction indicator
- Real-time trajectory updates
- Multiple shot comparison
- Elevation change visualization

#### 5. UI/UX Development (IN PROGRESS)
Enhancing user interface and experience.

##### Completed:
- Basic input controls
- Environmental conditions display
- Club selection interface

##### In Development:
- Mobile-responsive design
- Touch-friendly controls
- Quick preset buttons
- Save/load shot configurations

#### 6. New Features (PLANNED)
New functionality to be added.

##### Priority Features:
- Club fitting adjustments
- Ball model selection
- Ground condition effects
- Shot shape options (draw/fade)

##### Secondary Features:
- Statistical analysis
- Shot dispersion
- Course condition presets
- Historical shot tracking

### Testing Goals
1. Wind Effects:
   - All conditions within ±1% of targets
   - Validate intermediate speeds
   - Test diagonal winds

2. Environmental Effects:
   - Temperature: ±2% accuracy across range
   - Humidity: Validate minimal impact
   - Altitude: Match known course data

3. UI/UX:
   - < 2 second response time
   - Mobile usability score > 90
   - Accessibility compliance

### Next Steps
1. Complete wind effect calibration
2. Begin altitude validation
3. Enhance visualization features
4. Implement mobile-responsive design
5. Add new environmental factors

### Known Issues
1. Tailwind effect too strong at 20mph
2. 10mph headwind outside tolerance
3. Need intermediate wind speed validation
4. Mobile interface needs optimization
5. Visualization performance on slower devices

### Development Priorities
1. Wind effect accuracy
2. Altitude validation
3. Temperature/humidity refinement
4. Visualization enhancements
5. UI/UX improvements
6. New features
